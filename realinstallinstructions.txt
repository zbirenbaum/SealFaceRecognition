ok so ya gotta do this:
first get cuda 9.0. has to be 9.0, not 9.1, not 9.2, not 10, not 11. 9. if you ask about 8 ill be mad
then, get cudnn 7.0.5 for cuda 9 from nvidia. EZ

set it up with the proper paths and stuff

[virtualenv stuff]
dont use conda its garbage and for garbage people
use pyenv with virtualenvwrapper. setup sucks but its better than cleaning the mess you will make without it.


pyenv install python 2.7.18
pyenv global 2.7.18
mkvirtualenv <some name>
workon <some name>
pip install <requirements>

install tensorflow 1.7.0
clone original facenet and install from requirements one by one
when something fails just google until you think you might have the right versoin and then pray you are right.

if you were wrong, which you probably will be, just pip remove and install a new version.

if your virtual environment is irreperably fucked, just mkvirtualenv a new one.
